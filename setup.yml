audio:
    # Bitrate (int)
    # The radio will choose the stream with bitrate closest to the value you set.
    # 32 kbps - Poor audio quality
    # 48 kbps - A reasonable lower end rate for longer speech-only podcasts
    # 64 kbps - A common bitrate for speech podcasts.
    # 128 kbps - Common standard for musical and high quality podcasts.
    # 320 kbps - Very high quality - almost indistinguishable from a CD.
    bitrate: 128

    # Volume (int, 0 - 100)
    # This value shouldn't be too high, as the built in sound card isn't the best.
